# Optical Character Recognition

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) implemented with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow.

## Usage

Download the dataset in the link below to this folder and execute the "ocr_deep.py" file.


### Data set

The Chars74K dataset has been used to train this model. To train your model, it can be downloaded from http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/.

For this implementation the computer fonts version has been used, but it may work with the other versions too, you just need to change the "data_providers.py" path.
